All my C++ Create functions should return the thing they created (or throw?)
Should I be doing descriptor writes at draw time?
handle window resize - wait, destroy, recreate per-swapchain data
try a second object
cleanup - why shouldn't there be SUBMISSIONS_IN_FLIGHT count depth images?
add ImGUI?
raytracing
load simple gltf2s
